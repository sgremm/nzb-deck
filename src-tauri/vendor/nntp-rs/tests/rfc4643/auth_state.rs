//! RFC 4643 - Authentication Response Classification Tests
//!
//! **What This File Tests:**
//! This file contains tests that validate authentication response code classification
//! and constant definitions per RFC 4643. These tests verify that response codes are
//! correctly categorized as success, error, or continuation responses.
//!
//! **What This File Does NOT Test:**
//! This file does NOT test the authentication state machine logic. The actual state
//! machine testing is done in:
//! - `src/client.rs` (unit tests for ConnectionState transitions)
//! - `tests/auth_integration_test.rs` (integration tests calling real authenticate methods)
//!
//! **Why Tests Were Removed:**
//! This file originally had 27 tests, but 17 were "phantom tests" that created mock
//! responses and then verified the mocks matched themselves (e.g., `response.code == 381`).
//! These tests passed regardless of whether the real authentication logic worked.
//! They were removed and replaced with 21 real tests that call actual client methods.
//!
//! Reference: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4643#section-2.1
